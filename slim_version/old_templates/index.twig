	<h1 id="about">Hello, I'm Evan.</h1>
  <p>
	I'm a graduate of PDX Code Guild with a focus on mid-to-backend development. Among my favorite technologies are Python, Django, Javascript, relational databases (especially Postgres), and anything open-source. My days are often filled with finding ways to write code for good causes. I value breadth and versatility in my skillset and thrive on acquiring new skills and applying them to challenging problems. I'm methodical, empathetic, and enjoy collaborative work.

  When I'm not programming or reading about programming, I'm usually cooking up glorious low-carb meals and/or singing Renaissance music. I'm a musician turned programmer-musician! Before focusing on software, I studied music education. Now I apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to code. Read a more detailed bio <a href="#bio-and-contact">here.</a>
