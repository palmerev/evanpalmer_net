{% block intro %}
	<h2 id="intro">Hello! I'm Evan.</h2>
	<p>
		I'm a graduate of PDX Code Guild with a focus on mid-to-backend development. Among my favorite technologies are Python, Django, Javascript, relational databases (especially Postgres), and anything open-source. My days are often filled with finding ways to write code for good causes. I value breadth and versatility in my skillset and thrive on acquiring new skills and applying them to challenging problems.
	</p>
	<p>
	  When I'm not programming or reading about programming, I'm usually cooking up glorious low-carb meals and/or singing Renaissance music. I'm a musician turned programmer-musician! Before focusing on software, I studied music education. Now I apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to code. Read a more detailed bio <a href="#bio-and-contact">here.</a>

	Here's some of my recent work. In a future version of this site, this will interface with the GitHub API to update based on work I've recently committed. For now, this content is static.

{% block project1_desc %}
	<p>
		This is an application that generates ear training exercises for musicians, to help them identify intervals. It uses a simple wrapper called "tones" around the Web Audio API to generate sound in the browser with Javascript. The backend was originally built with Django using Python 2.7. When it is redeployed, it'll be in Python 3! There will also be more course content options, including chord and scale identification, and personalized courses based on past results. This was my capstone project at PDX Code Guild.

	"Raise Effect" API
{% endblock project2_title %}

{% block project2_desc %}
	<p>
		This was my first project with the volunteers of <a href="http://www.hackoregon.org">Hack Oregon</a>. I was one of the three backend developers who created the API serving a project called "Raise Effect", which showcases the effects of raising Oregon's minimum wage on different family types all 36 counties in Oregon. The API is built in Flask using Python 3, touching a PostgreSQL database deployed on AWS and served by gunicorn. I helped design and implement the API itself, contributed a large portion of the unit tests, and authored its documentation. This season's Hack Oregon projects go live on October 26th. You can see Raise Effect in action <a href="http://raiseeffect.org">here</a>.
