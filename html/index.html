            Hello, my name is Evan. I'm a graduate of PDX Code Guild with a focus on mid-to-backend development. Among my favorite technologies are Python, Django, Javascript, relational databases (especially Postgres), and anything open-source. My days are often filled with finding ways to write code for good causes. I value breadth and versatility in my skillset and thrive on acquiring new skills and applying them to challenging problems. I'm methodical, empathetic, and enjoy collaborative work.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not programming or reading about programming, I'm usually cooking up glorious low-carb meals and/or singing Renaissance music.

            I'm a musician turned programmer-musician! Before studying software seriously, I studied music education. Now I apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to code. Read a more detailed bio <a href="about.html">here.</a>
